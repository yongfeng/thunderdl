Installation instructions:
 # Install Thunder VIP
 # Unzip `ThunderVip\ThunderDL.exe` into any folder
 # Run ThunderDL.exe from command prompt
 # Enjoy

PS. Thunder VIP window will briefly appear for each download added. Please ignore.<br>
PS2. If there's an error, try running: `regsvr32.exe "C:\Program Files (x86)\Thunder Network\Thunder\bho\ThunderAgent.dll"`<br>
PS3. Custom save path only works when Thunder VIP is already running. This is a bug with Thunder dll.<br>
